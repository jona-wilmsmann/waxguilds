## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

### AtomicAssets

AtomicAssets has reached 248 million NFTs created on WAX, 8 million more than at the time of the last report

### AtomicHub / AtomicMarket

We released our AtomicHub Multichain Beta. This is a major development milestone for us, and one that we have been working on for over 8 months. Rather than simply adding a separate version of AtomicHub for a new chain, our Multichain beta combines all supported blockchains into a single unified experience.

We believe that this is a major UX improvement, and will allow us to support as much high quality content as possible. We also believe that through building a unified experience, in the long term we will be able to onboarded a significant number of crypto users outside of WAX onto WAX, as they will start using AtomicHub for other blockchains initially, but then organically discover WAX content and be onboarded into the ecosystem.

We also released a large number of small improvements and bugfixes as always.

### AtomicPacks / AtomicDrops

No updates.

### NFT Insider

No updates, NFT Insider continues to produce targeted, high quality content.

### Badge System

We have conducted hundreds of badge checks since the new badge system released, awarding content and identity badges to collections. The community reception of this feature has been extremely positive, and we feel this system will allow us to continue scaling with a safe, fair and transparent system.


## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Ecosystem Development?

We organized the inaugural AtomicHub Game Fest.

AtomicHub Game Fest (AHGF) is a mass participation event that celebrates the leading web3 gaming titles. We held our first AHGF from June 19-25, which saw;
- 150,000+ minutes of total stream watch time
- 250,000+ impressions across all socials
- Four Launchpad drops, with thousands of dollars generated
- Over $3,000 in crypto and NFT prizes distributed

We partnered with the Blumint to organize torunaments, received support from the WAX team, and parterned with 7 different WAX games to highlight throughout the week.

We believe this was a major success, being well received inside the community and also receiving some coverage from the outside. We are planning a second iteration to build on this success.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Community Engagement?

The AtomicHub Game Fest that we organized applies to community engaggement just as much as to ecosystem development.
